```{r}
featurePlot(x = data[],y= data$mpg)#plotting mpg with other variables this is very important.

#First we can see that am is for Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual) so here automatic transmission of gears give less mpg comparatively than manual.

#2nd in mpg vs gear plot we cam see that 4 gear cars give more mpg as compared to both 3 and 5 gears

#3rd carburetor is part of engine for airâ€“fuel ratio for combustion. We can see that as number of carburetors increase there is decrease in mpg

#4th drat is driver axle ratio which is directly proportional with mpg

#5th the weight vs mpg plot directly shows that its inversely proportional

#6th the qsec i.e performance measure shows that average performing cars i.e. cars with qsec ratio 18 to 20 gives most mpg

#7th 

#8th the cyl vs mpg plot shows that cars with 4 cylinders gives most mpg

#9th Here dist is engine displacement measured in cu in. From the plot we see that it is inversely proportional to mpg and dist depends on no. of cylinders

#10th the horse power vs mpg plot is clear that the more is hp the less mpg.
